    # LINEAR, EXPONENTIAL
    type: "LINEAR"

    # Linear algorithm is in the form of y=mx+c
    # where y is the price, m is increase-per-rank, c is base-cost, x is the rank)
    linear:
      increase-per-rank: 100
      base-cost: 100

    # Exponential algorithm s in the form of y=ab^x
    # where y is the price, a is the initial-amount, b is the growth factor, x is the rank
    exponential:
      initial-amount: 0
